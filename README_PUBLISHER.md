OpenClaw Users (Free)
    ↓ Install skill
MaclawPro Security Skill (Free)
    ↓ Try features
Discover limitations (no real-time alerts)
    ↓ Upgrade
MaclawPro Pro ($49/yr)
    ✅ Real-time alerts

    ✅ Dashboard analytics
    ✅ App blocking
```

### **Revenue Projection:**

```
Conservative (2% conversion):
60,000 users × 1% try skill = 600 users
600 users × 2% upgrade = 12 Pro signups
12 × $49/yr = $588/year

Moderate (3% conversion):
60,000 × 1% × 3% = 18 Pro signups
18 × $49/yr = $882/year

Optimistic (5% conversion):
60,000 × 2% × 5% = 60 Pro signups
60 × $49/yr = $2,940/year
